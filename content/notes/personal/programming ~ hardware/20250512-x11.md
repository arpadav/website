# X11 forwarding

Everytime I do this, I forget how to do it... since I never have to touch it again. Taking notes on a new computer.

I would really like to get this working without PuTTY but everytime I try it, it doesn't work.

## With PuTTY

### Source computer (Windows) w/ Putty

1. `winget install -e --id marha.VcXsrv`
2. Launch `XLaunch` and set to launch on start-up
3. Use PuTTY to ssh into the destination computer, enabling X11 in the PuTTY settings

### Destination computer (Linux) w/ Putty

```bash
# 1. try gedit / ffplay / whatever
```

## Attempt without PuTTY

This works when using PuTTY and then having a separate terminal open, but somehow just simply using `ssh -Y` or `ssh -X` doesn't work. This is an attempt but it wont work without PuTTY. If anyone has an actual solution please feel free to let me know what I'm doing wrong.

### Source computer (Windows) wo/ Putty

1. `winget install -e --id marha.VcXsrv`
2. Launch `XLaunch` and set to launch on start-up
3. `$env:DISPLAY='localhost:0.0'`
4. `ssh -Yv <user>@<ip>` where verbose flag is optional. 

### Destination computer (Linux) wo/ Putty

```bash
# 1. set $DISPLAY
export DISPLAY=:0.0 # or localhost:10.0 or whatever

# 2. apt install xauth and x11-apps
sudo apt install xauth x11-apps -y
touch ~/.Xauthority

# 3. try gedit / ffplay / whatever
```
