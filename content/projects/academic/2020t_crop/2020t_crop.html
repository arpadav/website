<p><i>Overview:</i></p>
<p>The goal of this project was to process aerial-view images of crops from NCSUs agricultural department, and use a
    deep learning model to process and use semantic segmentation in classifying areas of crop damage. The metric used
    for performance evaluation of the model was a mean IOU of the prediction within the validation set. This was a
    project for ECE 542.</p>

<p><i>My Contribution:</i></p>
<p>Group Project (3 members)</p>
<p>I worked with the same group as I did in <a href="/projects/2020t_terrain">Terrain Identification using
        Sensory Prosthetic Limb Timeseries Data</a>.</p>
<p>The training images were extremely high resolution, so I made a MATLAB script to downsize all aerial images as well
    as their respective crop-damage annotations to various sizes. I created multiple U-Net architectures in Keras to
    perform this semantic segmentation and trained a couple models for each resolution. As expected, models trained on
    the highest resolution photographs as well as the lowest resolution resamples performed the worst, since there is an
    expected trade-off between model speed/size and resolution/detail of the photographs. I also created a script to
    extract intermittent layers of the model to understand why and how the model was working.</p>
<p>Similar to <a href="/projects/2020t_terrain">Terrain Identification using Sensory Prosthetic Limb Timeseries
        Data</a>, I unfortunately did a disproportionate amount of the work. Not as bad this time, but I would say I did
    ~70%.</p>
