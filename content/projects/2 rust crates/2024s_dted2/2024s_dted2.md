_Overview_

[DTED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTED) is a format for storing elevation data. There existed a crate called [`dted`](https://crates.io/crates/dted), which was last updated 3 years ago. Usually with "outdated" Rust-projects, they still work fine, but they were using an outdated dependency of [`nom`](https://crates.io/crates/nom), which has since added optimizations in parsing times. This was simply done to update to the most recent version of `nom`.

There are some incomplete features of this crate, which don't explicitly adhere to the DTED standard. I have no intention on updating them simply due to time, but am open to PR's to implement them.

Note that I have since learned of the combinator parser library called [`winnow`](https://crates.io/crates/winnow), which is a 0-copy parser and significantly more intuitive to use than `nom`, and I would like to some day migrate to that. For the time being, this will do.

_README example_

```rust
use dted2::{ DTEDData, DTEDMetadata };

let data = DTEDData::read("dted_file.dt2").unwrap();
let metadata: DTEDMetadata = data.metadata;
// or can read just the header without the rest of the data
let metadata: DTEDMetadata = DTEDData::read_header("dted_file.dt2").unwrap();

// query elevation, returns None if out of bounds
let elevation: f64 = data.get_elevation(50.0, 10.0).unwrap();
```
