<p>that's me !</p>
<p>i am an aspiring electrical engineer from Charlotte, North Carolina. i aim to do research and intend to return
    for my PhD, if possible</p>
<p>i completed my <strong>masters of science in electrical engineering</strong> at North Carolina State
    University, with concentrations in <strong>signal processing + computational intelligence</strong></p>
<p>my well-versed interests include:</p>
<ul>
    <li> - computer vision + image processing + dsp</li>
    <li> - information theory + communications</li>
    <li> - deep learning + dl architecture</li>
</ul>
<p>other interests (of which i have limited experience with) include:</p>
<ul>
    <li> - foreign affairs</li>
    <li> - electroacoustic instrumentation + music theory</li>
    <li> - network security + cryptography</li>
    <li> - neuroscience + brain-computer interface</li>
    <li> - computational finance</li>
    <li> - number theory + topology</li>
</ul>
<p>in my freetime i enjoy working on projects, learning new languages, reading, running, and traveling</p>
<p>a good example of a project is this website, which i made completely from scratch with no external dependencies
