        <li>Mixture models are using some distribution in N-dimensional space and clustering for classification. For
            example, the figure above shows a data in 2 & 3-D spaces and how they would be classified using a Gaussian
            mixture model. Note that these classification models can be distinct (where each cluster is a seperate form
            of classification) or merged (where everything a cluster is something, and everything excluded is not
            something). For facial detection, a merged model is used in a high dimensional space for classifying whether
            something is a face or not. The dimensionality is based off the number of pixels in the training images.
            Below are 20x20 (row 1) and 25x25 (row 2 & 3) Gaussian mixture models with 8 clusters. The means of each
            cluster are displayed below:</li>

        <li>For this project, a t-Distribution, mixture of t-Distribution, as well as factor analysis were completed.

    <li><b>Project 2: Facial Detection using Viola-Jones Algorithm: Adaboost + Haar-like Features</b></li>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>Haar-like features can be used in junction with Adaboost to create a lightweight and fast facial detection
            model. It is colloquially known as the Viola-Jones object detection algorithm, but has been popularized for
            facial recognition. It is commonly used by digital cameras to detect faces prior to taking photographs. For
            this project, this was implemented and trained using a face dataset. To achieve the lowest of accuracies,
            only the first 10-20 features need to be checked, but to achieve the full accuracy of the model, all
            features must be checked in a cascade fashion. Below is a sample image alongside the 15 strongest features
            for the face dataset. A total of ~250 features were used in multiple models for this project. More can be
            read in the report below, see the <i>Literature</i> section.</li>

    <li><b>Project 3: Facial Detection using Simple Deep Learning</b></li>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li>Using a simple 2D CNN implemented using Python (Keras / Tensorflow), a facial detection model was made on
            the same dataset used in all 3 projects. Both training and validation accuracy were significantly higher
            than the previous two projects, which shows the power of deep learning, considering the fact that the model
            architecture is nothing novel, the dataset was not flawless, and the students in the class (including my
            teammates at the time) were relatively inexperienced with deep learning and its implementation. I would show
            visuals for this project as I did with the other two above, however all I would show are datapoints with
            their respective classification. A binary classification metric was used. More can be read in the report
            below, see the <i>Literature</i> section.</li>

<p><i>My Contribution:</i></p>
<p>For Project 3: Group Project â€” 3 members</p>
<p>The work for this project was more evenly spread out, as compared to previous projects I have had in graduate school.
    I did the data pre-processing from the face dataset, trained multiple models multiple datasets, visualized the
    intermittent layers of our most effective model, and wrote my fair share of the report. In can be noted in the
    report, that each member of the team had their own unique way of tackling the data pre-processing, so we trained our
    best selected models on all our datasets and included the results in the report.</p>
