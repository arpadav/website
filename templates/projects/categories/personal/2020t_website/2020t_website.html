<p><i>Overview:</i></p>
<p>I wanted to create a website which can hold my projects, notes, thoughts, and more. Essentially like an extended
  resume and / or blog.</p>
<p>I am a stickler for being minimalistic, using the least amount external modules as possible, and making generative /
  flexible pages.</p>
<p><b>This is why if you were to view the source of this page, all you see are iframes and embedded JS scripts.</b> Now
  if you were to use the 'inspect element' tool, you can see how the site is generated. I have used 0 external modules
  (i.e. no jQuery, AngularJS, NodeJS, etc.) and all design aspects (like animation, style, etc.) are unique to myself
  and my personality. This was done to limit my dependencies and to make the whole site more lightweight. Yes, I doubt
  it is as optimal or as fast as if I had additional help, but this was a personal decision.</p>
