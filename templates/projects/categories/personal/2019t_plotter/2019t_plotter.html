<p><i>Overview:</i></p>
<p>Generative adversarial network (GAN) is a type of deep learning architecture in which there are two networks being
    trained. The first is called a discriminator, which takes a set of data (usually an image) and determines whether it
    is among the set of data which is real, or among the set of data which is generated (or 'fake'). The second is a
    generator, who's job it is to generate fake data from random noise. These two networks train with/against one
    another, so both the discriminator and the generator get increasingly better at their respective tasks. The end
    result of the GAN is only the generator network, which is a network capable of generating realistic sets of data
    purely from Gaussian noise.</p>

<p>This sort of generative network has many applications, including the non-technical one being art.</p>

<p>A CNC laser engraver transformed into a 2D plotter (above) is used to plot the edges of some arbitrary GAN's output.
    The arbitrary GAN is initially trained on landscape portraits. The output (resembling a drawing/painting/photograph
    of a landscape) will be fed through a series of digital filters and an accompanying MATLAB script to extract edges
    (of varying degrees) and other features of the image which would seem fit to be plotted. The image is then
    transformed into a grbl file to be plotted.</p>

        used when I worked on the MATLAB script many years ago (independent of this project)</i></p>

<p>Currently, the post-processing of the output is complete, the plotter is assembled, and the I am working on
    programming, training, and tuning the GAN.</p>

<p><i>Personal Statement:</i></p>
<p>I have always been fascinated by how deep learning can be applied to art. I gained motivation for this project in
    2017, when I met <a href="https://twitter.com/VIDEODROME">Robbie Barrat</a> at the Intel ISEF in Los Angeles.
    Barrat, previously a AI researcher at NVIDIA and Stanford, is now an AI artist and fashion designer. He really
    piqued my interest in deep learning during my time in LA, which motivated me to pursue statistics, deep learning,
    and computer vision as some of my electrical engineering concentration topics.</p>
<p>The project is still in progress, but on hiatus due to focusing on graduate school. But I will be returning to it in
    the near future.</p>

<p><i>Literature:</i></p>
<p>There are a lot of problems with standard GAN's, like mode collapse, knowing the 'proper' ratio of training
    iterations for generator vs. discriminator, etc. One partial solution is the Wasserstein GAN, which uses the
    Wasserstein metric as the loss function as opposed to the standard KL Divergence (used to derive cross-entropy loss)
    and Jenson-Shannon Divergence.</p>
