<p><i>Overview:</i></p>
<p>A joke iOS application to send alerts to a group message</p>
<ol>
  <li>Send a message using text</li>
  <li>Send an audio message</li>
  <li>Send a message using Morse code</li>
</ol>
<p>Each message would then be accompanied by a timestamp as well as coordinates of the individual sending them. The
  message would be parsed outputted properly in a message format. Audio files would be uploaded to Google Drive, and a
  shareable link is generated. Morse code messages were in the form of text, where client-side Morse code audio 'beeps'
  are concatenated and uploaded to Google Drive, again with shareable links generated.</p>

<p>All of the messages would be sent in a specified format to an email for server to pick up push to the group message.
  Each email would contain the message information as well as coordinate information. The message information was
  compiled the following way:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Text: The message with text was compiled in a certain format, and sent to the specified email for parsing</li>
  <li>Audio: First the audio is recorded, stored in RAM of the iOS device, saved on the iOS device, attached to an email
    for further processing, then deleted from the iOS device</li>
  <li>Morse: The message is inserted as text, then pre-downloaded Morse code audio files are concatenated, saved on the
    iOS device, attached to an email for further processing, then deleted from the iOS device</li>
</ol>
<p>The server which was used to intercept these messages was a Raspberry Pi running a script, where on push
  notifications on incoming emails. Unfortunately it was extremely complex to purely use 3rd party Python libraries to
  work with the audio files, so I used Google's Gmail and Spreadsheet API's to parse the email upon reception, download
  the audio file in a specific folder and proper name, get the shareable link, append the message information as well as
  the Google Drive link in the spreadsheet, read the spreadsheet from the Raspberry Pi, and THEN send it to the group
  message. It was quite convoluted, but it worked with little latency.</p>
<p>The chat bot aspect came into play later on, when I was messing around with ways to interact with Google Hangouts.
  There is no Google Hangouts API available, so I had to use a very well made 3rd party Python library where Google
  Hangouts was essentially reverse engineered (see my GitHub the citation). I then realised that I was able to not only
  send messages, but read them. I can read a users name, email, timestamp, message, etc., and with this information, I
  decided to make a chat bot which parses a message, and if it sees a message command (we used exclamation point, e.g.
  !command) then it would parse the command and respond appropriately. Here are some examples of what it was able to
  accomplish:</p>

<p><i>Personal Statement:</i></p>
<p>This project was purely intended for joking purposes, but it ended up being a quite complex project so I decided to
  include it. One of my friends, studying archeology, had an excavation in Peru the summer of 2018. Never having been
  abroad, I decided to construct an iOS application for his phone where he can send 'alerts' to our group message if he
  is ever in 'trouble' in the ways outlined in Overview. Of course, any one of my friends could download it and have fun
  with it. Unfotunately, Apple was extremely stringnent on having this app available publically on the AppStore (for
  obvious reasons). I could still install the app onto any iOS device via my computer, but it would only function for a
  period of (if I remember correctly) 2 weeks. So my buddy was able to use it for a while before Apple prevented the app
  from launching again.</p>
<p>To get the iOS side of things working, I still required a server to run to intercept these messages. In addition, you
  can tell from Overview that I was experimenting with scripting for Google Hangouts, so the project morphed into
  including a chat bot as well. The server would pick up on push notifications from a certain group message, and respond
  a certain way depending on the different commands sent.</p>
<p>The iOS application icon ended up looking like this:</p>
